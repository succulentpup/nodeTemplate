Almost there.
Do the npm install and then start implement the endpoints in endpoints folder.
The name of your endpoint is the name of your file excluding the .js extension.


TDD based test cases should be part of tests folder.
Name of the test files should be same as it's source files but should end with .tdd.js instead of .js.
For eg: 
	End point name is health.
	It's calling functionality should be in health.js and this file should be in endPoints directory.
	It's test file should be named as health.tdd.js and should be in tests/endPoints path.
